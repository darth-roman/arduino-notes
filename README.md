# Hello There :wave:
This repo is my digital notebook on my journey for learning Arduino.
Along side with the codes that I 90% wrote lol :laughing:

Some of the my goals to create this repo:
* [ ] Create a public repo for sharing the learning journey as a beginner and for beginners.
* [ ] Learn MD note taking and becoming more productive
* [ ] Ease for revision later on
